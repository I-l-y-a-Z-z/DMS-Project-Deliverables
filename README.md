# DMS Project Deliverables

This repository contains the deliverables for the Data Management Systems (DMS) course projects. It serves as a collection of academic work, including project templates, reports, and related documentation. Note that this repository will be updated often as the projects evolve.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `DMG_Project_Template.tex`: A LaTeX template for structuring DMS project reports.
- `Deliverable1-DMSProject.pdf`: The first project deliverable, outlining the initial phase of the DMS project.
- `Deliverable1-DMSProject-CorrectedAfterDeadlineDoNotCount.pdf`: A revised version of the first deliverable, reflecting corrections made post-deadline.
- `Figures/`: A directory containing images and diagrams used within the project documentation.
